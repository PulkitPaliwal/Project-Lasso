# Project-Lasso
Welcome to project lasso, or CoinMaster, as I like to call it. This project was worked on under the course CS101. 
### main.cpp contains all the codes. Content of different files are indicated by comments("// filename")

* If you already have code blocks with simplecpp, download main.cpp and start working.
 	1) Open code blocks
	2) File -> Open -> choose main.cpp you downloaded just now.
	3) Now click Build and Run.
	4) if some error occurs, uninstall code block and follow next steps.

* If you don't have simple code block or error occurs while build, follow these steps.
	1) Download main.cpp and SimpleCodeBlocks setup.
	2) Double click SimpleCodeBlocks setup file and install it. Just follow along and click next.
	3) Open SimpleCodeBlocks
		a) Open code blocks
